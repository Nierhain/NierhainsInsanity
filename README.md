# Nierhain's Insanity
A Minecraft modpack made to dive into insanity

# Description
The original idea of this modpack was to create something for me and my friends to play with, but shortly began to evolve into something more... insane. Ever wondered what it would be like to fuse skyblock mods into a real world? Now you can experience this insane fantasy!

# Features
- Kitchen sink - all your favorite mods in one pack
- it's like Skyblock but without the void world
- fun and well sped up early progression

# planned
- Balance: every way of progression is (almost) equally efficient and fast
- Story & Quest System: Follow the journey of a man surrendering to madness ( not set in stone )
- Efficiency: no unneccessary weight to reduce loading times and prevent redundant machines
